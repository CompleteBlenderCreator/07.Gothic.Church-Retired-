# SECTION 7 Gothic Church
****

Part of the Complete Blender Creator course on Udemy, see [here](https://www.udemy.com/blendertutorial/?couponCode=GitHubSpecial) for a special GitHub offer. The full course is part of [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/how-to-create-3d-assets-using-blender-online-cours) Kickstarter campaign which was 1000% funded.

These are just the files from the course, not the actual tutorial videos. At the time of writing this course has several hours of high-quality videos.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files!

Enjoy yourselves.

# Section Introduction

* You are going to make several models. 
* We’ll be making both high poly and low poly versions of out assets.
* We will emphasise how critical naming is when working with a larger project like this.
* You will be able to create your own mapping, with these we can make the illusion of detail.
* We’ll be constantly checking our model externally
* This will be focused mainly on an interior environment.

# Section Specification

* Create assets to be exported straight into an external program, like a game engine.
* Creating our own textures, and other maps from high detail models and apply them to a low poly version.
* Only modelling the interior of the Gothic Church.

* You can use this technique within Blender itself too for optimisation. 
* I am going to be testing my model externally as I go. I will use Unity to do this.

* I will be keeping my scene simple, primarily for teaching purposes! 
* I encourage you to add more detail, experiment and have fun. Wouldn’t the scene look much more interesting with a chess set in it…

# Planning Your Project
* Plan your project, define it’s scope and your goals- important to prevent scope slip!
* Gather your reference material, if possible explore real world locations to get a feeling. Scour the web for images for you references too.

# Walking And Flying Around The Model
* See how our scene looks and feels walking around it. Using the Fly / Walk Mode.
* Show you how to see the scene in Unity.
* Understand I am using Unity to keep the iterations quick and simple at this early stage.

* Anything external to Blender, you can watch to see how it works and is coming across.
* Better understanding of external programs.
* Join in, if you have Unity installed and are interested in learning more about this prototyping method.

# Light Portals
* Learn how to use light portals.
* Understand the limitations of their use.
* See that they dramatically increase quality and are especially useful for indoor environments.
* They aren’t used externally to Blender. 

# UV Mapping In Blender

* No long ask what does UV stand for?!
* Overview the mapping in upcoming lectures
* Understand that we will be creating these maps from scratch, and then using them again to speed up further workflow.
* X,Y and Z are used for the Co-ordinates.
* UV are like the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ co-ordinates of an image.
* UV mapping is the process of projecting a 2D image to a 3D model's surface.
* They create the illusion of surface detail by mapping part of an image to the geometry on our model. 
* They can be applied automatically, great for basic models. Generating a UV map gives best results.
* Diffuse Map: The base colour of the geometry.
* Bump Maps: Tell the shader how to react with light.

# The Multi-Resolution Modifier
* Learn how to use the multi resolution modifier.
* See it is great for multiple resolutions of a model.
* Learn to control how sharp edges.
* Understand that this is best apply to a base mesh that is the final low-poly version. 

# Solving Issues With Subdivision
* See a potential issue you may encounter when you use any form of subsurface division.
* Finish off the solution to the previous challenge.

# Copying Mesh Properties
* Learn how to copy attributes of a mesh object.
* See this is great when you have lots of components, for e.g. need the same material.
* Understand it’s a destructive operation e.g. copying materials will overwrite a meshes current materials.
